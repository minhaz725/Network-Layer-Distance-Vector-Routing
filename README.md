Distance Vector Routing




In this assignment, you will modify a given template (JAVA) to simulate simplified version of
\Distance Vector Routing (DVR)".




1. A topology of routers is given as an input in topology.txt. File input/output is managed
in the template. The topology contains the list of connected routers (routerId) and IP
Addresses of all interfaces against each router. The first interface given in the file is always
dedicated for connecting end devices.

2. Open Constants.java. There are two defined constants. One is INFTY which models the
infinite distance. The other one is LAMBDA, used to define the rate of altering the state of
routers (A functioning router might be switched o or a router which was switched o might
be turned on). LAMBDA must be within [0,1]. The higher the value is, the more router state
changes will occur. An instance of RouterStateChanger.java does the job for you.

3. A server (NetworkLayerServer.java) first reads the topology and lists the interfaces of
routers to connect end devices (client). Each interface is a key in clientInterfaces map,
where the value represents the number of end devices connected to that interface (initially
0).

4. While reading the topology, the server creates instances of Router. You have to modify
Router.java to complete its functionalities. More specifically, you need to implement the
following:
/*
Initialize the distance (hop count) for each router.
For itself, distance = 0; for any connected router with state=true,
Otherwise, distance = Constants.INFTY;
*/
public void initiateRoutingTable() {
}
/*
Delete all the routingTableEntry
*/
1
public void clearRoutingTable() {
}
/*
Update the routing table for this router using the entries of Router
neighbor
*/
public void updateRoutingTable(Router neighbor) {
}

5. In NetworkLayerServer.java, you will implement an algorithm which can be considered
similar to DVR. The pseudocode is given below:
while(convergence) {
/* convergence means no change in any routingTable before and after
executing the following for loop
for each router r
starting from the router with routerId = startingRouterId, in any
order */
{
1. T <- getRoutingTable of the router r
2. N <- find routers which are the active neighbors of the current
router r
3. Update routingTable of each router t in N using the
routing table of r [Hint: Use t.updateRoutingTable(r)]
}
}
Caution: In real-time networking, the routers are isolated. So, the perfect modeling should
have been to implement each router as a separate thread. But here, we are controlling the
updates of routing table of all routers from the server from a single thread to make things
simple. Please note that this is not the exact version of DVR. It is a trade-o where you
will understand how DVR works and also things are a little bit easier for you to implement.
Here the algorithm starts with the first router (routerId = startingRouterId) sending its
routing table to its neighbors which are in \UP" state. The sequence of other routers does
not matter. Note that, you may need to make sure router state does not change until the
algorithm fnishes executing.

6. You will find two functions in NetworkLayerServer.java: While implementing DVR() , you
are supposed to implement it with split horizon and forced update as discussed in theory
2
class. You will find the class lecture in \LectureNL.pdf"; While implementing simpleDVR(),
you will implement the same thing but without split horizon and forced update.

7. Now, we will start connecting clients. For this, you may need to adjust or add new codes
inside NetworkLayerServer.java, ServerThread.java and Client.java. Read these files
very carefully for instructions.

8. Your task is to enable the client adjusting NetworkLayerServer.java and ServerThread.java
for the tasks given as pseudo-code below. Remember, you have major works to do for the
tasks in ServerThread.java.
Receive EndDevice configuration from server
[Adjustment in NetworkLayerServer.java: Server internally handles a list
of active clients.]
for(int i=0;i<100;i++) {
Generate a random message
if(i==20) {
Send the message to server and a special request "SHOW_ROUTE"
Router assigns a random receiver from active client list
[Adjustment required in ServerThread.java].
Display routing path, hop count and routing table of each router
[You need to receive all the required info from the server in response
to "SHOW_ROUTE" request]
}
}
else {
Client sends the message to Server, which [Adjustment required in
ServerThread.java] assigns a random receiver from active client list.
}
If server can successfully send the message, client will get an
acknowledgement along with hop count. Otherwise, client will get a failure
message [dropped packet]
Report average number of hops and drop rate

9. Use instances of Packet.java for sending and receiving messages or requests. You can insert,
update, delete any attribute of Packet class if required.

10. Finally, write a report comparing
3
• average number of hops and drop rate for LAMBDA = 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.80.
Just show the stats in a table, nothing else.
• Apply simpleDVR() instead of DVR() keeping LAMBDA = 0.10 and compare how drop
rate changes because of implementing split horizon and forced update. Briefly put your reasoning.
